    <h1>About Me</h1>
    

    <p>My name is Jonathan Hood, and I am a professional embedded software developer. I am currently employed at ADTRAN as a design engineer. I studied Software Engineering at Mississippi State University. There, I worked on the MSU EcoCar Team on the digital gauge cluster and infotainment center projects. I primary develop for web sites and embedded systems, though I have tinkered with other areas. I'm hugely interested in development of software for linux based embedded systems and maintenance of linux based servers.</p>
<p>I've created this site as a way to remember some of the lessons I've learned. This site also serves as a repository for projects I've finished working on. Maybe the projects will be useful to someone else as well, if it is useful to you please email me!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jonathan Hood (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:me&#64;jonathanhood.org">me&#64;jonathanhood.org</a>)</p>
